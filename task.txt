You are going to create a ReactJS application that manipulates a cash balance on an account using Redux.

● This app should contain 4 buttons named:
    ○ Withdraw,
    ○ Deposit,
    ○ Add Interest,
    ○ and Charges.

● It must also include one input box that you will use to enter the amount that you wish to deposit or withdraw.
    ○ Include the space to view your balance as it gets updated.

● The store will store the current balance of the account.

● If the Deposit button is clicked, the balance amount should increase
by the input value from the input box.

● If the Withdraw button is clicked, the balance amount should
decrease by the input value from the input box.

● If the Add Interest button is clicked, the balance amount should
increase by 5%.

● If the Charges button is clicked, the balance amount should decrease
by 15%.
